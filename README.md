# Stellar x402 Executor

> A Web3-native execution agent — pay per job in USDC via x402, verify identity on-chain, run sandboxed Docker tasks, get cryptographically signed results.

[![CI](https://github.com/nirmalplays/Stellar-x402/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nirmalplays/Stellar-x402/actions)

## What This Is

A pay-per-execution agent infrastructure built on Stellar. Any AI agent or HTTP client can:

1. **Discover** your agent via `/.well-known/x402` or `/api/discovery`
2. **Pay** in USDC using the x402 protocol (or legacy XLM)
3. **Execute** a sandboxed Docker job
4. **Receive** a cryptographically signed, validated result

Built for the agentic economy — no API keys, no centralized billing, no trust assumptions.

## Quickstart

### 🚀 Run a Node on a Potato PC

Want to join the x402 network and earn USDC by running agents (like Openclaw)? Use our interactive setup script:

```bash
python scripts/setup_node.py
```

This will:
- Generate your Stellar keys
- Configure your `.env`
- Register you in the Soroban registry
- Set up a secure **Secrets Vault** for your API keys

---

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirmalplays/Stellar-x402.git
cd Stellar-x402
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOYER_PUBLIC_KEY` / `DEPLOYER_SECRET` | Account that owns the registry contract |
| `EXECUTOR_PUBLIC_KEY` / `EXECUTOR_SECRET` | Account that receives payments |
| `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed Soroban registry contract ID |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | ⚠️ Your public URL — required for discovery to work |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_URL` | Facilitator endpoint (default: `https://x402.org/facilitator`) |
| `X402_PRICE` | Price per job in USDC (default: `0.01`) |

Generate and fund testnet accounts at: https://lab.stellar.org

> **Note:** If `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` is not set, all jobs are refused by default.
> For local dev without a deployed contract, set `REGISTRY_BYPASS_DEV=true`.

### 3. Run

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Dashboard opens automatically at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 4. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:8000

---

## Payment Methods

### Primary: x402 v2 (USDC via facilitator)

This is the standard x402 protocol. The client pays USDC and retries with the payment proof.

```
POST /execute/stream
Header: X-Payment: <PaymentPayload JSON>
```

Two facilitator options:
- **Coinbase** (testnet, no key needed): `https://x402.org/facilitator`
- **OpenZeppelin** (testnet + mainnet, API key required): `https://channels.openzeppelin.com/x402/testnet`

Compatible wallets: Freighter (browser extension), Albedo, Hana, HOT, Klever, OneKey.

### Fallback: Legacy XLM

Send 0.05 native XLM directly to `EXECUTOR_PUBLIC_KEY` and pass the transaction hash:

```
POST /execute/stream
Header: X-Stellar-Payment-Tx: <transaction_hash>
```

Prepare an unsigned transaction first:
```bash
POST /api/x402/prepare-payment
Body: {"source_public_key": "G..."}
```

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/execute/stream` | SSE streaming execution (primary) |
| `POST` | `/execute` | Single JSON response (non-SSE clients) |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/x402` | Standard x402 discovery |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery` | Agent card + x402 hints |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/resolved` | Merged on-chain + IPFS metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/vault` | Wallet balances + transaction history |
| `GET` | `/api/activity` | Live event feed |
| `POST` | `/api/pay` | Demo: auto-send 0.05 XLM (dev only) |
### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Stellar-Payment-Tx: YOUR_TX_HASH" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agent_402",
    "task": "run playwright script",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.43.0-jammy",
    "cmd": "npx playwright test",
    "allow_browser": true,
    "allow_network": true
  }'
```

---

## Features

### 🌐 Browser Automation
By setting `"allow_browser": true` and `"allow_network": true` in your `JobRequest`, the executor node will:
- Enable internet access for the container.
- Allocate `1GB` of Shared Memory (`shm_size`) for Chromium.
- Relax PID limits to allow multiple browser processes.

### 🔒 Secrets Vault
As a node runner, you can safely pass API keys to your agents without exposing them to the network.
1. Create a `.env` file in the `secrets/` directory: `secrets/<agent_id>.env`
2. Add your keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
3. The `DockerRunner` automatically injects these into the container environment at runtime.

---

## On-Chain Registry

```json
{
  "job_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": "4",
  "verified": true,
  "signature": "...",
  "log": ["..."]
}
```

---

## On-Chain Registry

The Soroban registry contract stores:

```rust
pub struct Agent {
    pub owner: Address,
    pub metadata_cid: String,  // IPFS CID
    pub reputation: i64,
    pub active: bool,
}
```

Deploy the contract:

```bash
cd contracts/registry
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/registry.wasm --network testnet
```

Register your agent:

```bash
python scripts/registry_client.py
```

Publish metadata to IPFS (optional):

```bash
# Set PINATA_JWT in .env first
python scripts/publish_agent_metadata_ipfs.py
```

---

## Security

Docker jobs run in strict isolation:

- No network access (`--network=none`)
- 256MB memory limit
- 0.5 CPU limit
- 64 process limit
- Read-only filesystem
- No new privileges
